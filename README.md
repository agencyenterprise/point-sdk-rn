## Add private pod specs repo to your cocoa pods local installation

Our Swift PointSDK pod is published under this private specs repo, so you'll need to add it to your cocoa pods repo list first

## Getting started

`$ npm install react-native-point-sdk --save`

### Mostly automatic installation

`$ react-native link react-native-point-sdk`

## Usage
```javascript
import PointSdk from 'react-native-point-sdk';

// TODO: What to do with the module?
PointSdk;
```
